# Cursor Terminal Wrapper Fix

## Date: 2024
## File: cursor.sh

### Issue Resolved:
**Problem**: When executing `cursor` or `cursor .` in terminal, the terminal remained occupied and closing the terminal would also close Cursor application.

**User's Previous Solution**: Had a function in `.zshrc`:
```bash
function cursor {
  setsid /usr/bin/cursor "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
}
```

### Implementation:
Created a wrapper script at `/usr/local/bin/cursor` that replaces the simple symlink, providing detached terminal execution.

**Wrapper Script Content**:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Cursor wrapper script - launches detached from terminal
exec setsid "$HOME/.local/share/cursor/cursor" "$@" >/dev/null 2>&1 &
```

### Technical Details:
- **Location**: `/usr/local/bin/cursor`
- **Method**: `setsid` creates new session, detaching from terminal
- **Output**: Redirected to `/dev/null` to prevent terminal output
- **Execution**: Background execution with `&`
- **Arguments**: All arguments passed through with `"$@"`

### Benefits:
- Terminal is immediately freed after running `cursor` command
- Cursor continues running even if terminal is closed
- Works with any arguments (`cursor .`, `cursor file.txt`, etc.)
- Universal solution (works with bash, zsh, fish, etc.)
- No need to modify user's shell configuration files

### User Experience:
- Run `cursor` or `cursor .` and terminal is immediately available
- Cursor opens in background without cluttering terminal
- No dependency on specific shell configurations
- Consistent behavior across different terminal environments
